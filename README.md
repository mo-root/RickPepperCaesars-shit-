# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game AI with Viterbi Algorithm ü§ñ‚úÇÔ∏èüßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

Welcome to the **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game AI** repository! This project implements an AI for the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the AI learns to predict the player's next move based on observed game outcomes. Using the **Viterbi algorithm** and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), the AI improves its prediction strategy over time.

## How It Works üéÆ

In the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, there are three possible moves: **Rock (R)**, **Paper (P)**, and **Scissors (S)**. The AI predicts the player's next move based on previous outcomes using a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** approach.

### Steps:
1. **Transition Matrix**: Tracks how likely the player is to move from one choice to another.
2. **Observation Matrix**: Tracks the probability of a game outcome (Win, Lose, Tie) for each possible move.
3. **Viterbi Algorithm**: Predicts the most likely sequence of moves based on past observations.
4. **Dynamic Updates**: After each round, the AI updates its matrices, improving predictions over time.

## Mathematical Foundation üßÆ

The Viterbi algorithm uses **dynamic programming** to determine the most likely sequence of hidden states (player moves) based on observed events (outcomes). The core concept is based on the **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**, where:

- **States**: The possible moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
- **Observations**: The possible outcomes of each game (Win, Lose, Tie).
- **Transition Probabilities**: The likelihood of transitioning from one move to another.
- **Observation Probabilities**: The likelihood of an outcome based on a move.

We define:
- \( T[i, j] \): Transition probability from state \( i \) (previous move) to state \( j \) (current move).
- \( O[j, k] \): Observation probability for outcome \( k \) given state \( j \).

The Viterbi algorithm recursively computes the most likely sequence of moves using these probabilities.

## Code Logic üíª

### Key Components:
1. **Transition Matrix**: Tracks the transition probabilities between moves (Rock, Paper, Scissors).
2. **Observation Matrix**: Tracks the probabilities of outcomes (Win, Lose, Tie) based on moves.
3. **Viterbi Algorithm**: Predicts the most likely sequence of moves based on previous outcomes.
4. **Game Simulation**: AI plays against the player, dynamically updating its model based on the results.
5. **Dynamic Matrix Updates**: After each round, the matrices are updated based on the latest game outcome.

## Game Simulation & Results üéâ

We simulated 100 random games to evaluate the AI's performance. During these simulations, the AI used its learned model to predict the player's next move and update its strategy accordingly.

### Accuracy & Precision üîç:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of rounds in which the AI correctly predicted the player's move.
- **Precision**: The percentage of times the AI's predictions were correct among the total predicted outcomes. After simulating 100 random games, the AI achieved a **precision of 41%**! This means that 41% of the time, the AI was able to make accurate predictions based on its model.

üéØ **Precision result**: **41%**

The AI‚Äôs performance improves as it learns from more games. The model continuously refines itself, adapting based on the outcome of each round.
